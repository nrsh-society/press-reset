# Zendō: improve your mental fitness

Improve your meditation with real-time biofeedback. Track how your meditation experience is altering your physiology, relaxing your body, and building your awareness.

# Practice. Observe. Improve.

Designed to accompany your meditation practice, Zendō allows the ever-growing community of meditators to look within while monitoring heart rate variability (HRV), a measure empirically correlated with a sense of well-being and positive health outcomes.

## Record Your Meditation Sessions

Start Zendō on your Apple Watch similar to how you would record a regular workout session. Use it along with apps such as Headspace and Calm.

## Analyze Each Meditation

Dive into your stats after meditation. Using Health Kit, Zendō is able to measure HRV and other health indicators during meditation. It also creates a mind & body workout for each meditation session, working in concert with Apple Activity app. 

## Monitor HRV (Heart Rate Variability)

Track your meditation journey while monitoring your HRV. As your mindful minutes increase, your HRV will (typically) increase and likewise your overall sense of well-being.
